# OpenCaldera
An open project looking to expand the (Dell) Alienware Graphics Amplifier (Caldera) to support Nvidia RTX 3000 and AMD RX 6000 series GPUs.

This project is designed to probe and potentially expand GPU support in the Alienware Graphics Amplifier (Caldera) to include Nvidia RTX 3000 series and AMD RX 6000 series GPUs.
As of this writing (11/19/2020), Alienware (Dell) has indicated that AGA is "soon to be end of life", and "will not be validated with RTX 3xxx video cards". 
(Source: https://www.dell.com/community/Alienware/AGA-Alienware-Graphic-Amplifier-FAQ/td-p/7243433)

Support for AMD RX 6000 series GPUs at the current time is unknown.
